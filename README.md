# NotesApplication
A useless notes app. It's supposed to be a demonstration of MVP, RxJava and Dagger2 in Android. It's a quick implementation and should not be used as a reference. The Readme will be updated when the code is in a better condition. 

The app allows you to see a list of notes. You can also add, delete and modify any note. Each note contains a title and description along with an optional image. 

# TODO
- UI improvements
- If the user deletes the image from local storage, the app will crash
- Code structure improvements
- Better error handling
- Add persistent storage
- Connect with a remote server, maybe Firebase!
